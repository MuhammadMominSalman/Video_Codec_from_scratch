# Video Codec Implementation in MATLAB

This repository contains a custom implementation of a video codec, developed entirely from scratch in MATLAB. The codec is designed to compress and decompress video files, providing a practical demonstration of video encoding and decoding techniques.

## Features

- **Custom Encoding**: Encode raw video data into a compressed format.
- **Custom Decoding**: Decode the compressed video back to its original format.
- **Frame-by-Frame Processing**: Handle each video frame individually, allowing for precise control over the compression process.
- **Support for Different Compression Techniques**: Implement various compression methods like DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform), motion compensation, and more.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   https://github.com/MuhammadMominSalman/Video_Codec_from_scratch.git

2. **Ensure you have MATLAB installed:**
   This project requires MATLAB to run. Make sure you have it installed on your machine.
   
3.**Open the project in MATLAB:**
   Start MATLAB and navigate to the cloned directory to begin working with the codec.


   
## Usage

To use the codec, follow these steps:
### Prepare your video file:

Ensure the video file is in a supported format (e.g., .yuv).

### Run the encoding script:

Use the provided MATLAB script inside final_encoder.m to encode your video.
Use the provided MATLAB script inside final_decoder.m to decode your video.

### View the results:

Use any yuv video player to view the compressed and decompressed videos.

## File Structure

final_encoder.m: Main script for encoding video files.
final_decoder.m: Main script for decoding video files.

## Examples

Check out the examples for sample videos and scripts that show how to use the codec.
